    "TZVPD stands for **Triple-Zeta Valence with Polarization and Diffuse functions**.  It is a type of **basis set** used in quantum chemistry calculations, in this case is used by the ORCA software. Basis sets are important in computational chemistry because they define the set of functions used to describe the electronic wave function of molecules. They are a collection of functions used to create and model the molecular orbitals of a system.\n",

    "- **<span style=\"color:#BA55D3;\">Triple-Zeta (TZ):</span>** it means that **three** functions are used to describe each valence orbital, providing a more accurate representation compared to single-zeta or double-zeta basis sets. The valence orbitals are the outermost orbitals of an atom that are involved in chemical bonding. The different types of valence orbitals are s, p, d and sometimes f. \n",

    "\n",
    "- **<span style=\"color:#3CB371;\">Polarization (P):</span>** adds extra features to account for how the electron cloud is distorted by the molecular environment, improving the accuracy of the calculations.\n",
    "    - Think about a water molecule (H‚ÇÇO). The oxygen atom has s and p orbitals that help it bond with hydrogen. When it forms bonds with hydrogen, the electron cloud around oxygen can become distorted. Adding polarization functions (e.g. d-type functions for oxygen) can help us model this distortion better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<span style=\"color:#DAA520;\">Diffuse (D):</span>** includes extra functions that are more spread out in space. These are important for accurately describing anions and systems with weakly bound electrons.\n",
    "    - Think about a chloride ion (Cl‚Åª). The extra electron in Cl‚Åª is not as tightly bound as the electrons in a neutral chlorine atom. To describe this loosely bound electron correctly, we add special functions (e.g., additional s and p functions with larger exponents) to the basis set. This allows the basis set to capture the electron's extended distribution.\n",

# ⚛️ openCOSMO-RS Guide ⚛️

This Jupiter Notebook serves as a comprehensive guide to using openCOSMO-RS on **Windows** for predicting solvation phenomena and thermodynamic properties of fluid systems. openCOSMO-RS is a powerful tool that uses computational chemistry to provide insight into molecular interactions and solvation behavior

The **goal** of this guide is to provide a **step-by-step tutorial** on how to set up and use openCOSMO-RS, covering the following key aspects:

- Introduction to theoretical concepts
- Software Requirements
- Input File Preparation
- Various examples and applications of the program
- Result Analysis.
